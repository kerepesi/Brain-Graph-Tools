***PREREQUISITES***

- Linux OS
- Perl v5.14.2 or later 
- Download the brain graphs from http://braingraph.org/download-pit-group-connectomes/
- copy 100307_connectome_scale500.graphml file to the directory of RefBrainGraph.pl


***BUDAPEST REFERENCE CONNECTOME WORKFLOW***

Version 1.0:

- download the 6 brain graphs and unzip them
- create a 6_BrainGraphs directory (mkdir 6_BrainGraphs) and copy the brain graphs to it
- download all files of the BrainGraphTools and copy them to the directory where the 6_BrainGraphs directory is

- perl RefBrainGraph.pl -MinC 3 -MinStr 0 -StrMerge avg -Out graphml -Project 1.0 > 6_BrainGraphs-RefBrainGraph-C3.graphml

Version 2.0:

- download the partial set, 96 brain graphs from http://braingraph.org/download-pit-group-connectomes/ and unzip them
- create a 96_BrainGraphs directory (mkdir 96_BrainGraphs) and copy the brain graphs to it
- download all files of BrainGraphTools and copy them to the directory where the 96_BrainGraphs directory is

- all: perl RefBrainGraph.pl -MinC 48 -MinStr 0 -StrMerge avg -Out graphml -Project 2.0 > 96-all-RefBrainGraph-C48.graphml
- female: perl RefBrainGraph.pl -MinC 26 -MinStr 0 -StrMerge avg -Out graphml -Project 2.0-F > 52-F-RefBrainGraph-C26.graphml
- male: perl RefBrainGraph.pl -MinC 22 -MinStr 0 -StrMerge avg -Out graphml -Project 2.0-M > 44-M-RefBrainGraph-C22.graphml


***BRAIN DIVERSITY WORKFLOW***

- download the full set, 392 brain graphs from http://braingraph.org/download-pit-group-connectomes/ and unzip them
- create a 392_BrainGraphs directory (mkdir 392_BrainGraphs) and copy the brain graphs to it
- download all files of BrainGraphTools and copy them to the directory where the 392_BrainGraphs directory is

Generate input graph list:

- cd 392_BrainGraph
- ls *_connectome_scale500.graphml > ../all_392_scale500.list
- cd ..

Prefiles:

- perl -w GenPreFile.pl 1 100 all_392_scale500.list 392_BrainGraphs
 
Compute brain diversity:

- perl -w BrainDiversity.pl all_392_scale500.list-GenPreFile-1.csv 392 0 lobes distr_func


***BRAIN EVOLUTION WORKFLOW***

- download the partial set, 96 brain graphs from http://braingraph.org/download-pit-group-connectomes/ and unzip them
- create a 96_BrainGraphs directory (mkdir 96_BrainGraphs) and copy the brain graphs to it
- download all files of BrainGraphTools and copy them to the directory where the 96_BrainGraphs directory is

Generate input graph list:

- cd 96_BrainGraph
- ls *_connectome_scale500.graphml > ../all_96_scale500.list
- cd ..

Prefile:

- perl -w GenPreFile.pl 1 100 all_96_scale500.list 96_BrainGraphs/

Compute brain evolution:

- perl -w BrainEvolution.pl results/all_96_scale500.list-GenPreFile-1.csv 96 1015
